				My name is Jus, and I enjoy the act of creation. The
				feeling of keys under my fingertips, the feeling of code
				compiling, the feeling of no runtime errors, the feeling of a
				completed project â€” these are irreplaceable joys understood by
				craftswomen and men across the world; though immature in my
				career, an artisan I am included, and these joys I understand.
				<br></br>
                <br></br>
				My main focus these days is building e-commerce and blog-type
				websites that not only meet the aesthetic eye but function
				seamlessly, ensuring a satisfying user experience that converts
				visitors into loyal users. Each project is a new canvas, upon
				which I leverage my skills in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and
				MongoDB, woven with lacework of GraphQL. My preferred tech stack
				is MERN with GraphQL, but I am also trained in RESTful APIs. I
				use JavaScript primarily, but consider myself adept in Java, as
				well, and am currently learning TypeScript and Python.
				<br></br>
                <br></br>
				When away from my desk, you'll find me engrossed in a good
				anime, manga, or book!
